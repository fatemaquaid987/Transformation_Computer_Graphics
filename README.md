# Transformation_Computer_Graphics
A computer generated three-dimensional spiral which can be scaled and rotated. 

# Files: 
matrix.h  
spiral.c  
vshader.glsl  
fshader.glsl  
initShader.c  
initShader.h 
The file spiral.c contains main() function along with other functions that make
up the spiral.   
matrix.h contains all the matrix function signatures.  


# How to run the code: 
Follow the intructions given in the SETUP.md file to make the necessary installations and setup.  
Create a new project (in Visual Studio) with all these files and run.  

# How to operate:
